This page documents version compatibility between Guestbook components and upgrade considerations.

## Current Versions

- **Kiosk Client**: 0.1.3
- **Backend API**: 1.0.0
- **Admin Portal**: 1.0.1

## Compatibility Matrix

### API Contract Compatibility

The backend API uses versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/`) to maintain backward compatibility. The admin portal and kiosk client are designed to work with the current API version.

| Component | Backend API Version | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Admin Portal 1.0.1 | API v1 | ✅ Compatible |
| Kiosk Client 0.1.3 | API v1 | ✅ Compatible |

### Breaking Changes

Currently, there are no documented breaking changes. Future breaking changes will:
- Be announced in release notes
- Use new API version paths (e.g., `/api/v2/`)
- Maintain previous versions for a deprecation period

## Upgrade Considerations

### Backend API Upgrades

When upgrading the backend API:

1. **Database Migrations**: Always run migrations before starting the new version
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
2. **Environment Variables**: Review new required variables in release notes
3. **API Changes**: Check for new endpoints or changed response formats
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Verify existing clients still work

### Admin Portal Upgrades

When upgrading the admin portal:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
2. **Backend Compatibility**: Verify backend API version is compatible
3. **Build Process**: Run `npm install` to update dependencies
4. **Stack Auth**: Verify Stack Auth configuration is still valid

### Kiosk Client Upgrades

When upgrading kiosk clients:

1. **Backend Compatibility**: Ensure backend API supports the client version
2. **Configuration**: Existing configuration is preserved during upgrades
3. **Device Registration**: No re-registration needed unless device ID changes
4. **Sidecar Compatibility**: Verify camera sidecar version matches (if using camera scanning)

## Version Coupling

### Tight Coupling

- **Device Registration**: Kiosk client must use backend API v1 device registration endpoint
- **Entry Submission**: Kiosk client must match backend API entry format
- **Authentication**: Admin portal must use compatible Stack Auth version

### Loose Coupling

- **Admin Portal ↔ Backend**: Admin portal can work with any backend version that supports the same API endpoints
- **Kiosk Client ↔ Backend**: Kiosk client can work with any backend version that supports device authentication and entry submission

## Deprecation Policy

When features are deprecated:

1. **Announcement**: Deprecation announced in release notes
2. **Support Period**: Feature remains functional for at least one major version
3. **Migration Path**: Clear migration instructions provided
4. **Removal**: Feature removed in a future major version

## Testing Compatibility

Before deploying upgrades:

1. **Test in Staging**: Deploy to staging environment first
2. **Verify Endpoints**: Test all critical API endpoints
3. **Check UI**: Verify admin portal functionality
4. **Test Kiosks**: Verify kiosk client can submit entries
5. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for errors or warnings

## Version-Specific Notes

### Backend API 1.0.0

- Initial stable release
- PostgreSQL database required
- Stack Auth authentication
- Device versioning system implemented

### Admin Portal 1.0.1

- Next.js 16
- Stack Auth integration
- Requires backend API v1

### Kiosk Client 0.1.3

- Tauri 2.x
- HID device support
- Camera sidecar integration (optional)
- Requires backend API v1

## Future Compatibility

As the platform evolves:

- **API Versioning**: New API versions will use new path prefixes
- **Feature Flags**: Some features may be gated by version checks
- **Migration Tools**: Automated migration scripts for major upgrades
- **Compatibility Matrix**: This page will be updated with each release

## Recommendations

1. **Stay Current**: Keep all components updated to latest compatible versions
2. **Test First**: Always test upgrades in a staging environment
3. **Read Release Notes**: Review changes before upgrading
4. **Backup First**: Always backup databases before major upgrades
5. **Monitor After Upgrade**: Watch logs and metrics after deployment

## Getting Version Information

### Backend API

```bash
# Check package.json
cat guestbook-express/package.json | grep version

# Or check API health endpoint
curl https://api.guestbook.software/api/health
```

### Admin Portal

```bash
# Check package.json
cat guestbook-admin-portal/package.json | grep version
```

### Kiosk Client

```bash
# Check package.json
cat guestbook-client/package.json | grep version

# Or check from running client (browser console)
getAppVersion()
```
