This page focuses on extending the **admin portal** in this repository.

## Extension philosophy

- Prefer configuration over forks
- Keep UI changes localized (components and pages)
- Keep upgrade paths predictable

## Safe extension areas

- Adding columns or filters to existing tables
- Extending the Reports export flow (CSV output)
- Adding admin-only pages for new backend endpoints
- Updating branding for the portal UI

## High-risk areas

- Changing API response expectations without updating the backend
- Duplicating backend logic in the UI
- Embedding org-specific rules directly into shared components
