## Glossary

### A

**Admin Portal**  
The Next.js web application (`guestbook-admin-portal`) that provides administrators with a UI to view entries, manage devices, export data, and configure organizations. Also referred to as the "admin UI" or "web portal."

**API Backend**  
The Express.js REST API (`guestbook-express`) that manages entries, devices, guests, organizations, and user authentication. Also referred to as the "backend API" or "backend service."

### B

**Barcode Scanner**  
A hardware device (HID-compliant) that reads barcodes and sends the data as keyboard input to the kiosk client. Can also refer to camera-based scanning via the camera sidecar service.

### C

**Camera Sidecar**  
A Python service that runs alongside the kiosk client to provide camera-based barcode scanning. Communicates with the kiosk client via HTTP on `http://127.0.0.1:7313`.

**Check-in**  
The process of a guest recording their visit at a kiosk, typically by scanning an ID card or barcode.

### D

**Device**  
A kiosk hardware unit running the kiosk client. Each device has a unique 6-character ID and an authentication token.

**Device ID**  
A 6-character identifier (e.g., `ABC123`) that uniquely identifies a kiosk device in the system.

**Device Token**  
An authentication token used by kiosk devices to authenticate with the backend API. Stored securely in the kiosk client configuration.

**Device Version**  
A versioned record of device attributes (name, location) stored in the `device_versions` table. Allows historical tracking of device changes over time.

### E

**Entry**  
A record of a guest check-in, including guest identifier, device used, timestamp, and optional metadata. Stored in the PostgreSQL database.

### G

**Guest**  
A person who checks in at a kiosk. Guests are identified by a onecard (barcode value) and optionally a name.

**Guestbook**  
The overall platform consisting of the kiosk client, backend API, and admin portal.

### H

**Heartbeat**  
A periodic health check sent by kiosk devices to the backend API to indicate the device is online and functioning. Updates the device's `last_sync` timestamp.

**HID (Human Interface Device)**  
A USB device standard that allows devices like barcode scanners and magnetic stripe readers to appear as keyboard input to the operating system.

### K

**Kiosk**  
A dedicated hardware device (typically a Raspberry Pi, tablet, or workstation) running the kiosk client application in fullscreen mode for guest check-ins.

**Kiosk Client**  
The Tauri-based desktop application (`guestbook-client`) that runs on kiosk hardware to capture guest entries and submit them to the backend API.

### O

**Onecard**  
A barcode value or identifier used to uniquely identify a guest. Typically scanned from an ID card.

**Organization**  
A tenant or organizational unit in the system. Devices and users can be associated with organizations for access control and data segregation.

**Orphaned Device**  
A device that has been deleted from the backend but still has local configuration. Indicated by a 403 Forbidden response when attempting to submit entries.

### P

**PostgreSQL**  
The relational database used by the backend API to store entries, devices, guests, organizations, and user data.

### S

**Stack Auth**  
The authentication service used by Guestbook for user authentication and authorization. Provides role-based access control and organization membership management.

**Sidecar**  
See "Camera Sidecar"

### T

**Tauri**  
The framework used to build the kiosk client, combining a Rust backend with a web-based frontend (TypeScript/HTML).

### V

**Versioning (Device)**  
The system of tracking device attribute changes over time using the `device_versions` table, allowing historical accuracy when querying entries.
