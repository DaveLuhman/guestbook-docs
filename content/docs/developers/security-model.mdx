This page describes the security posture for the admin portal.

## Baseline assumptions

- The portal runs in a browser and relies on backend APIs
- PII may be present in entries and exports
- Admin access must be restricted and audited

## High-level controls

- Stack Auth handles authentication
- Backend enforces authorization (Owner/Manager/Viewer, Superadmin)
- Secure transport (TLS) for all network calls

## Input security

- Validate server-side (always)
- Sanitize where it helps, but don’t rely on client-side enforcement
- Keep error messages helpful but not leaky
