This page focuses on debugging the admin portal.

## Debugging checklist

- Reproduce reliably (or define trigger conditions)
- Separate concerns:
  - client UI
  - backend services
  - network path

## Common issues

### Auth failures (401/403)
- Confirm Stack Auth configuration values
- Verify the Stack Auth project allows the portal origin
- Confirm backend permissions align with the user’s role

### API contract mismatch
- Confirm client/server versions
- Confirm payload shapes and error envelopes
- Prefer backward-compatible fixes where possible

### Empty tables or export results
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- Inspect network responses for empty data or errors
- Confirm the backend supports the filter parameters being sent
