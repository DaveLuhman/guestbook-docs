## What this covers
This page summarizes the integration patterns used by the admin portal and available for external integrations.

## Admin portal integration patterns

The admin portal uses these patterns internally:

- **Direct REST API calls** from the browser to the backend (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`)
- **Server-side Next.js routes** for simple portal utilities (health, contact form, setup scripts)

## External integration patterns

If you're building integrations with the Guestbook platform:

### REST API integration

The backend API (`guestbook-express`) provides a REST API that can be consumed by external systems:

- **Authentication**: Use Stack Auth for user authentication, or device tokens for kiosk authentication
- **Endpoints**: All endpoints are under `/api/v1/` (see [API Reference](/docs/developers/api-reference))
- **Response format**: Standard envelope format with `success`, `data`, and `error` fields

### Direct database access

Direct database access is **not recommended** for external integrations:
- Database schema may change without notice
- Bypasses business logic and validation
- Lacks proper access control and auditing

Use the REST API instead.

## Unsupported patterns

The following integration patterns are **not implemented**:

- **Webhooks**: No webhook support for entry events
- **Event-driven**: No pub/sub or event streaming
- **Scheduled sync**: No built-in batch synchronization
- **GraphQL**: REST API only, no GraphQL endpoint

If you need these patterns, you would need to implement them as custom extensions to the backend API.
