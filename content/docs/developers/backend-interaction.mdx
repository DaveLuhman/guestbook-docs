This page describes how the admin portal talks to the backend API.

## Communication patterns

The portal uses a simple request/response model via `lib/api.ts`:

- `fetch` requests are made from the browser
- Authorization uses a Stack Auth access token in the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header
- The client expects JSON responses

## Error handling

The API client normalizes common HTTP errors:

- **401 Unauthorized**: clears cached token and prompts a new auth flow
- **403 Forbidden**: indicates insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: endpoint or resource missing
- **409 Conflict**: indicates a conflicting state (e.g., resource already exists)

The UI surfaces these errors in tables and modals without exposing sensitive details.

## Contract stability

If you version APIs:

- Prefer additive changes over breaking payload reshapes
- Keep response envelopes consistent to reduce client-side branching
