This section documents the **admin portal** codebase and its API contract. The Guestbook platform consists of three components:

- **Admin Portal** (this repository): Next.js web application for administrators
- **Backend API** (separate repository): Express.js REST API with PostgreSQL database
- **Kiosk Client** (separate repository): Tauri-based desktop application for kiosk devices

Kiosk runtime and backend services are maintained in separate repositories and are referenced here when they impact the portal's behavior.

## Who this section is for

This section is for people building or integrating systems around the admin portal: API consumers, platform engineers, and developers extending the portal UI.

## If you're in the wrong place

- If you're operating kiosks day-to-day, head to **Administrators**.
- If you're using a kiosk to check in, start in **Users**.

## This section's contract

We'll be precise and avoid guessing. When details are implementation-specific, the docs should either:
- link to the canonical source, or
- clearly label placeholders until the implementation is finalized.
