The admin portal in this repository does **not** implement kiosk scanning or barcode input. Scanner integration is owned by the kiosk application and any local device runtime used by that application.

## Where scanner integration lives

Scanner integration is implemented in the **kiosk client** repository (`guestbook-client`). The kiosk client supports:

- **HID barcode scanners**: USB HID-compliant barcode scanners that appear as keyboard input
- **Magnetic stripe readers**: USB HID MSR devices (e.g., MagTek readers)
- **Camera-based scanning**: Python sidecar service for Raspberry Pi camera barcode detection

## How it works

1. **HID devices**: The kiosk client detects and manages HID devices automatically. When a barcode is scanned, it appears as keyboard input and is captured by the application.

2. **Camera scanning**: The kiosk client spawns a Python sidecar service that continuously captures frames from a camera, decodes barcodes, and streams results via HTTP on `http://127.0.0.1:7313`.

3. **Entry submission**: Once a barcode is captured (via HID or camera), the kiosk client submits it to the backend API via `POST /api/v1/entries/submit`.

## For implementers

If you are implementing scanner support in the kiosk client:

- Refer to the kiosk client repository documentation
- See `guestbook-client/src-tauri/src/devices/` for HID device management
- See `guestbook-client/sidecar/` for camera sidecar implementation
- Backend device APIs handle device authentication and entry storage

The admin portal only displays the resulting guest and entry data—it does not interact with scanners directly.
