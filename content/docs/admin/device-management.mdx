This page describes device management **as surfaced in the admin portal**. Device provisioning, kiosk imaging, and peripheral setup are handled by the kiosk application and backend services, not this repository.

## What the admin portal supports

From the Devices page, admins can:

- View device inventory reported by the backend
- See status and last-seen fields (based on backend sync)
- Update a device’s name and location
- Retire a device (mark it inactive)

The portal does not perform kiosk resets, OS-level remediation, or peripheral diagnostics.

## Device assignment and org context

Organization ownership and device attachment are managed by the backend. When the backend supports it, the Organizations page can attach or detach devices from an org for reporting and access control. If your backend does not expose this, device assignment is read-only.

## Operational tips

- Keep device IDs stable; they are treated as primary identifiers in the admin UI
- If a device shows as offline, verify backend connectivity and last sync timestamps first
- Use “retire” for devices that are decommissioned or lost to prevent stale data
