This page describes configuration for the **admin portal** in this repository. Kiosk form configuration and on-device branding are owned by the kiosk application and backend and are not configured here.

## Admin portal configuration

The admin portal is configured entirely through environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file (for local development) or set environment variables in your deployment platform.

### Required environment variables

**Stack Auth Configuration:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID` - Your Stack Auth project identifier
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY` - Stack Auth publishable client key (safe for browser)
- `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` - Stack Auth secret server key (server-side only, never expose to browser)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL` - Stack Auth API base URL (default: `https://api.stack-auth.com`)

**Backend API Configuration:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API base URL (default: `http://localhost:3001`)

### Optional environment variables

**Email Configuration (for contact form):**
- `CONTACT_EMAIL_TARGET` - Email address to receive contact form submissions
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server hostname (e.g., `mail.smtp2go.com`)
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port (e.g., `2525`)
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP password
- `SMTP_FROM` - From address for emails (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)

**Node Environment:**
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production` for production builds (affects optimizations and error handling)

## What can be customized

The admin portal provides limited customization options:

- **Authentication**: Configured via Stack Auth environment variables
- **Backend connection**: Set via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- **Email delivery**: Configured via SMTP settings (if contact form is enabled)

The portal does **not** provide UI controls for:
- Kiosk field configuration (name, location, etc.)
- Data retention policies
- Device provisioning
- Entry form fields

These are managed by the backend API and kiosk application.

## Operational guidance

- Keep the backend API base URL stable across environments
- Validate that Stack Auth configuration matches your environment (dev/stage/prod)
- Use least-privilege access for admin accounts, since the portal can export data containing PII
- Store `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` securely—never commit it to version control or expose it to the browser
- Use HTTPS in production for all API connections
