This page focuses on reporting features available in the admin portal.

## What data is visible in the portal

The portal renders entry data provided by the backend API. Common fields include:

- Guest identifiers (name, onecard)
- Device context (device ID, name, location)
- Timestamps (visit and submission times)

The exact shape depends on your backend API implementation, if different than the default.

## Common workflows

- Attendance reporting for an event/session window
- Visitor logs by location and date
- Investigating “did they check in?” questions

## Exports

The Reports page exports **CSV files** using filters for:

- Guest or device selection
- Date range (start/end)

Exports happen client-side, so treat downloaded files as sensitive:

- Share intentionally
- Store according to policy
- Delete when no longer needed

## Retention

Retention is enforced by the backend, not by the admin portal. If you don’t have a policy, decide one early—retention is easiest to manage before you have years of data.
