This page covers troubleshooting for the **admin portal**.

## First triage questions

- Is it one user or everyone?
- Did anything change recently (deployment, env vars, backend)?
- Is the failure consistent or intermittent?
- Can you reproduce it?

## Common symptoms

### Can’t sign in
- Confirm Stack Auth configuration values are present
- Check that the Stack Auth project allows your portal origin
- Verify the browser can reach the Stack Auth API URL

### Data tables are empty or failing
- Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points to the correct backend
- Look for 401/403/404 errors in the browser console
- Verify the backend API is reachable from the user’s network

### Exports are empty
- Ensure a date range is selected
- Select at least one guest or device
- Confirm the backend is returning entries for the chosen filters

## Escalation checklist

When escalating to the dev/integrator team, include:
- Portal URL and environment (dev/stage/prod)
- Date/time (with timezone)
- The backend API base URL
- What you expected vs what happened
- Any screenshots or console errors available
