This page covers monitoring for the **admin portal**, not kiosk runtime health.

## What “healthy” looks like for the portal

- Admin UI loads and authenticates successfully
- API calls return data without 401/403 errors
- Reports export without failures

## What to monitor (MVP)

- Web app availability (uptime)
- Backend API reachability from the browser
- Error rate trends in the client (401, 403, 404, 5xx)

The portal also exposes a basic health endpoint at `/api/health` for uptime checks.

## Device status in the portal

Device “Online/Offline” values come from the backend’s `last_sync` calculations. The portal does not poll devices directly.

## Alerting expectations

Alerts should answer:
- What broke?
- Where is it?
- Who owns the fix?
- What’s the immediate workaround?

Avoid noisy alerts. If everything is urgent, nothing is.
