This section focuses on the Guestbook admin portal contained in this repository. It covers how operators use the web app to review entries, manage devices, and export data. The kiosk runtime and backend services are maintained in separate codebases and are not deployed from this repo.

## Who this section is for

This section is for people who **deploy, configure, and support** the Guestbook admin portal day-to-day: IT staff, site owners, and anyone responsible for keeping the admin UI healthy and connected to the backend.

## If you're in the wrong place

- If you're **building integrations or extending behavior**, jump to **[Developers & Integrators](/docs/developers)**.

## How this documentation is organized

Everything here is written from an admin/operator perspective. When you need implementation detail, we'll link you over to the developer docs explicitly. Anything kiosk-specific is intentionally out of scope here.
