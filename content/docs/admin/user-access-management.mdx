This page describes how access is represented in the admin portal.

## Roles in this portal

The portal displays roles as provided by the backend:

- **Superadmin**: based on Stack Auth team membership (e.g., the `superadmins` team)
- **Owner / Manager / Viewer**: organization roles coming from the backend API

## What you can do today

- Superadmins can create users from the Users page
- All admins can view users and organization memberships
- Role changes and advanced user actions are not yet implemented in the UI

## Least privilege, in plain language

Give people the minimum access needed to do their job.
- Don’t hand out admin just because it’s easier
- Treat exports as sensitive by default (they can contain PII)

## Account lifecycle basics

- Use named accounts (avoid shared credentials)
- Remove access when staff change roles
- Document who owns break-glass access for emergencies
