This page focuses on operating the **admin portal** safely.

## Network exposure (high-level)

- Keep the admin portal behind authenticated access (Stack Auth)
- Serve the portal over HTTPS
- Limit backend API exposure to the portal’s origin where possible

## Secrets and configuration

- Treat `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` and SMTP credentials as secrets
- Store secrets in your hosting platform’s secret manager
- Never expose server-side keys to the browser

## Data handling

- Assume exports contain PII
- Keep access limited and auditable
- Prefer policy over tribal knowledge
