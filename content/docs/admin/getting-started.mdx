This guide walks you through deploying the admin portal for the first time.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Backend API**: The backend API (`guestbook-express`) must be deployed and accessible
- **Stack Auth Account**: A Stack Auth project configured with:
  - Project ID
  - Publishable client key
  - Secret server key
  - API URL
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Network Access**: Ability to reach the backend API from your deployment environment

## Deployment Checklist

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <admin-portal-repo-url>
cd guestbook-admin-portal
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (for local development) or configure environment variables in your deployment platform:

**Required:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID=your-stack-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=your-publishable-key
STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=your-secret-server-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL=https://api.stack-auth.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.guestbook.software
```

**Optional (for contact form):**
```env
CONTACT_EMAIL_TARGET=admin@yourdomain.com
SMTP_HOST=mail.smtp2go.com
SMTP_PORT=2525
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Verify Backend Connectivity

Test that the backend API is reachable:

```bash
curl https://api.guestbook.software/api/health
```

Or test from your deployment environment to ensure network access.

### 4. Build and Deploy

**Local Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access at `http://localhost:3000`

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

**Docker Deployment:**
```bash
docker build -t guestbook-admin-portal .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env guestbook-admin-portal
```

### 5. Initial Access

1. Navigate to your deployed admin portal URL
2. Sign in using Stack Auth (you'll need an account in your Stack Auth project)
3. Verify you can see the dashboard

### 6. Verify Functionality

- **Dashboard**: Should show recent entries and device status
- **Devices**: Should list devices registered with the backend
- **Entries**: Should display entry data from the backend
- **Organizations**: Should show organizations (if configured)

## Post-Deployment

### Create Initial Organization

1. Navigate to Organizations page
2. Create your first organization
3. Assign devices to the organization (if applicable)

### Invite Additional Admins

1. Go to Users page
2. Create additional admin users (requires superadmin privileges)
3. Invite users to organizations as needed

### Configure Email (Optional)

If you want the contact form to work:
1. Set up SMTP credentials
2. Configure environment variables
3. Test the contact form

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Sign In

- Verify Stack Auth configuration values are correct
- Check that your Stack Auth project allows your portal origin
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_API_URL` is correct

### Empty Dashboard

- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points to the correct backend
- Check backend API is running and accessible
- Verify backend has data (entries, devices)

### API Errors (401/403)

- Check backend API authentication is working
- Verify device tokens are valid (for kiosk submissions)
- Ensure Stack Auth tokens are being passed correctly

## Next Steps

- Review [Device Management](/docs/admin/device-management) for managing kiosks
- See [Configuration](/docs/admin/configuration-customization) for customization options
- Check [Troubleshooting](/docs/admin/troubleshooting) for common issues
